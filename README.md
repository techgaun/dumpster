## Welcome to our language / framework evaluation playground

We've committed some different pieces of code during our evaluation of various languages and frameworks, this is the central place for all that.  Note, many languages we don't have as much experience in, so you may see some fairly simple scripts and its really for us to play around and try all the exciting languages out there.
